After 10 years of experience in Interior Design, hospitality and Project Management, I am venturing into the world of web development to better reach clients and showcase my skills. 
I have demonstrated great ability to assist and coordinate companies team with the execution of multiple sales. Working with BELT, I have developed relationships for projects with
